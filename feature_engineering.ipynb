    "\n",
    "Imputation is a more preferable option rather than dropping because it preserves the data size. However, there is an important selection of what you impute to the missing values. I suggest beginning with considering a possible default value of missing values in the column. For example, if you have a column that only has 1 and NA, then it is likely that the NA rows correspond to 0. For another example, if you have a column that shows the “customer visit count in last month”, the missing values might be replaced with 0 as long as you think it is a sensible solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason for the missing values is joining tables with different sizes and in this case, imputing 0 might be reasonable as well. Except for the case of having a default value for missing values, I think the best imputation way is to use the medians of the columns. As the averages of the columns are sensitive to the outlier values, while medians are more solid in this respect."

In terms of years, yes, they are identical, but for all other aspects, 5 years of difference in young ages mean a higher magnitude difference. This type of data comes from a multiplicative process and log transform normalizes the magnitude differences like that.\n",
    "It also decreases the effect of the outliers, due to the normalization of magnitude differences and the model become more robust.\n",
    "A critical note: The data you apply log transform must have only positive values, otherwise you receive an error. Also, you can add 1 to your data before transform it. Thus, you ensure the output of the transformation to be positive."
